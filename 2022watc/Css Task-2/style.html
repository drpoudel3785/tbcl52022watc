    <h3>Cascading</h3>
    <span style="font-weight: 800">
      Stiye can be added as an inline elment using the style attribute on tags
      as is the case for this paragraph. Here font-weight has been given a
      weight of 800.
    </span>
    <div class="coded">
      <code
        >The inline style takes precedent over all other style declarations.
        Next in order of precedent is the embeded style. This uses style tags
        and is often found in the header section of a page. This pre tag is
        styled with embedded style. An extra large green font.</code

    </div>
    <p>
      Ideally style is held seperate to structure in a style sheet. Other than
      the 2 examples above all other style on this page is in a seperate style
      sheet. Including the change of base font to Arial.
    </p>
    <h3 id="selector">Selectors</h3>
    <p>
      CSS selectors are used to apply style. There is the element selector,
      class selector and id selector. All being well you have used an element
      selector to modify the font on this page by adding style to the body tag
      in your attached style sheet. Words in this<span class="selector">
        sentence </span
      >have been<span class="selector"> styled </span> using a class selector
      applied to letter-spacing and the heading for this section with an id
      selector.
